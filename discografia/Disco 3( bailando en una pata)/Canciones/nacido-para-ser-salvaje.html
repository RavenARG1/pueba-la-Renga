            <p class="clase_de_letra"> Get your motor running, 
                Head out on the highway, 
                Looking for adventure,
                In whatever comes our way.
                Yeah, darling, gonna make it happen.
                Take the world in a love embrace.
                Fire all of your guns at once
                And explode into space.</p>

                <p class="clase_de_letra"> I like smoke and lightning,
                    Heavy metal thunder
                    Racing in the wind.
                    And the feeling that I'm under.</p>

                <p class="clase_de_letra"> Like a true nature child we were born, born to be wild.
                    We have climbed so high,
                    Never wanted to die.</p>
